#### **DAY 6: Mind the Gap \~ Information Seeking and Knowledge Bridging**

#### **Greetings!**

I'm Peggy French, a current Program Manager with eCampusOntario with
Mohawk College in Hamilton ON as my home base. Since graduating library
school in 2002, I've worked at each type of library (academic, public,
and special) in Alberta and Ontario. After a Master's in Educational
Technology (UBC) in 2010, I moved into the Centre for Teaching and
Learning, but keep my library land learning close.

I realize not everyone's goal in life is to craft the perfect search
string or build the most searchable repository, so I promised Jenni I
wouldn't take folks too far down the research rabbit hole.

#### **Intention**

The purpose of this module is to provide you with an opportunity to
explore the following:

-   Initial impulses for information seeking;

-   Savvier search strategies;

-   Relevant resources for open.

#### **Concept in Context**

Piggybacking, as well as backtracking 2 decades, on Jenni's MOOC opening
and the individual's sensemaking in organizations through Weick, you
land on Dervin and her sensemaking methodology for individuals in life's
contexts. You also land more squarely in library land and its focus on
information seeking and information use behaviours.

As illustrated by her famous (well, library land famous) diagram
(replicated above), Dervin's sense-making is depicted using a
bridge-building metaphor, creating a way across \'a gappy reality\'
which allows the individual\'s conceptual journey to resume. As such,
Dervin\'s gap is both a barrier to sense-making and a prompt to action;
for example, to undertake information seeking. Bridges are not
automatically built. There is a running internal dialogue that analyzes
each gap \~ is it too wide and deep i.e., too risky to cross or is the
gap considered small and its impact insignificant i.e., not knowing is
considered o.k.. Individuals making the same decision, to bridge the
information gap, will not construct the same bridge.

There are many many factors underpinning the differences in bridge
building, but they tend to fall into two, interrelated, big buckets:
experience and identity. Previous decisions, goals, traditions, social
networks, emotion, values, etc. all contribute to our sensemaking,
bridge building, and information seeking. Dervin described reality as
evolving and perceived differently by each human and attributed
individuals with a kind of momentum (or inertia) in the form of a
constant revision of the sense they can make of the world. \'The human
condition \[is\] a struggle through an incomplete reality\... Humans
make sense individually and collectively as they move: from order to
disorder, from disorder to order\' (Dervin, 2000, p. 40-41). Consider
this sense-making a verb, constantly in action, not a noun.

How do you build your bridges? What is your threshold for bridge
building? How different are your materials if you are bridge building
for personal or professional reasons? No matter how sturdy and strong
your bridge is, there are always enhancements. Welcome to bridge
building 101.

#### **Another Gap to Mind and Mine**

Access to new sources, that you put into context and connect, overcome
the gap and build your bridge. It appears as a contradiction that in the
(post) information age, when access to information is easier than ever
before, it is actually more challenging to find information, if quality
and relevance are key.

We have all waded through those fruitless searches retrieving in 620 000
000 results and quickly learned to combine a few tips and tricks for
better results. For example:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  handy quotation marks to   information age versus "information age"
  force a phrase search      
  -------------------------- --------------------------------------------
  site: to limit to          term site:gov.on.ca returns results only
  specifics domains          from government of Ontario sites

  term x -term y to focus in "Michelle Obama" -Barack -president would
  if the term is connected   return sites that refer to Michelle Obama
  with multiple phrases      without referencing her husband or his title
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Perhaps less relevant to your academic needs, but still a tad amusing...

\*celebrity name\* Bacon number returns the celebrity's degree of
separation from Kevin Bacon, purported to be 6 or lower. Try it out!

These tips likely assisted with the critical components of a relevant,
savvy search \~ balancing precision and recall.

on the right pointing up. Precision is written above the line on the
right and recall written below the line on the left. The image shows the
tension between precision and recall in a search.
](media/image1.png){width="6.152777777777778in" height="4.375in"}

Again, without going down the rabbit hole of information retrieval
sciences or binary classification, precision would be the relevant
number of items in your results. Recall would be the results themselves
and what percentage of the total number of relevant items were retrieved
through your search. In other words, using strategies you managed to
reduce your results to 132. Of that 132, 47 were on point or precise to
your information need. However, there exists in the information sphere,
257 items that would have been on point to recall. Your search(es)
didn't return the majority of relevant information.You could likely
build your bridge, but it may not be the strongest of bridges.

#### **Step One**

How could your search(es) have better recall and precision a.k.a build a
stronger bridge?

#### **Step Two**

Now that you have isolated the best bet for a searchable question, you
need to build the search itself. This is where you can begin to narrow
precision further. From the searchable question, separate out the search
terms.

#### **Step Three**

This is where you can really boost recall. You have the established
terms, but what language would other people use? If your information
need is academic, you might stay with synonyms in the same vein. If you
want the broadest perspective, include slang and everyday lingo. Let's
keep it academic. Add synonyms for the four terms on our collaborative
Padlet, [Synonyms for Savvier
Searching](https://padlet.com/eCampusPeg/vqlox2u46yqg).

#### **Step Four**

Regardless of where you are searching, using parentheses, AND, and OR
will build the savviest search and allow you to build the strongest
bridge.

(term 1 OR synonym OR synonym...) AND (term 2 OR synonym OR synonym\...)
AND (term 3 OR synonym OR synonym...) ...

Using OR broadens the search, including all possibilities, but using AND
forces each term to be included and narrows the search. There's that all
important balance again. Given the amount of information, you can afford
to be quite specific. However, feel free to start broader e.g., using
our first three terms and then easily narrow by adding the fourth.

While these steps will assist in bridging all your information gaps,
they will be especially important in searching when there is no
established or controlled vocabulary e.g., Google. While you can perform
a far more powerful subject search in Library databases and some other
repositories, many only have a keyword search option. It is here I
plunge my hands deep into my cardigan and adjust my glasses as the
Librarian in me screams to dive deeply into these differences. However,
I have learned most people do have the same enthusiasm for keyword
versus subject searching that I do.

I will just include this gem from one of library land's more creative
and dedicated Librarians, Tami Albin creating at The University of
Kansas.

#### **Open Passage and Continual Upgrades**

From Helen's informative module on Creative Commons, you learned more
about your options and alternatives to the lockdown nature of copyright.
Her enthusiasm is contagious! You will likely want to apply your search
strategies to finding open material that is reusable, adaptable, and
shareable.

Since the bridge metaphor has been with us all along... Building with
open resources means you won't need to purchase costly materials and you
can add improvements and connect materials easily and ethically,
customizing how you bridge your information gap. Your bridging can then
'pay it forward'; your bridge can provide safe passage for others or
they can re-use materials from your bridge to build their own.

Below is a small sampling of what's available to curate and \| or adapt
for your teaching and learning. They highlight lesser known options from
the more mainstream [TED talks](https://www.ted.com/talks), [Khan
Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/),
[PhET](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/category/new), and [MIT
Open Courseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm). More and more,
repositories are establishing for a specific discipline or information
need. Consult with your Library or send us a Tweet if you want
assistance tracking down a discipline-specific resource for open. If you
find a gem, share it (Tweet \@livingkatstone, email
open@ecampusontario.ca).

#### **General Open Repositories**

##### **[OER Metafinder](https://mason.deepwebaccess.com/mason__MasonLibrariesOpenEducationResources_5f4/desktop/en/search.html) a.k.a Google for OER**

George Mason University has built a search engine federating searches
from popular OER around the world. It searches open textbooks,
libraries, museums, and organizations.

##### **Open Culture**

From movies, music, audio books to more academic resources such as
courses and textbooks, it advertises itself as "the best free cultural
and educational media on the web". To get in the open groove, follow
Open Culture on Twitter or subscribe to its daily email to get oriented
toward open.

##### **[MERLOT](https://www.merlot.org/merlot/index.htm) (Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and Online Teaching)**

The granddaddy of open repositories serving all levels of education with
over 40 000 objects in 19 material types. Peer reviews and monthly
awards help ensure quality and currency.

##### **OER Commons**

Curated from academic institutions, organizations, and government, it
filters for over 20 material types and covers K-post secondary
education.

#### **Image Searches**

Google, Bing, flickr all allow you to filter for licensing. Easily
narrow in on images you can legally, ethically, and freely use in your
teaching, presenting, etc. Other sites like Pixabay and Unsplash are all
openly licensed \~ no filtering needed.

#### **Open Access (Journals)**

The movement for opening up research is gaining momentum. Publicly
funded research at our institutions and within government should be
freely available. Slowly, academia is breaking through the illogical
practice of publicly funded researchers producing knowledge, publishers
packaging it, and then publishers selling it back to academia and the
researchers who created it.

Check in with your Library and Librarians to get the full scoop on open
data in your discipline, but here are some options for finding your
critical academic research out in the open.

##### **PLOS (Public Library of Science)**

For over 17 years, it has grown in its "mission to accelerate progress
in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research
communication" ([www.plo.org](http://www.plo.org/)). Check out [its
areas of concentration](https://www.plos.org/publications). Of interest
will also be its [curated collections](http://collections.plos.org/),
pulling from journals and its networked blogs to present the full
research picture on a number of areas.

##### **DOAJ (Directory of Open Access Journals)** 

Founded in Sweden 15 years ago, it now boasts over 3 million articles
from over 11 500 open access journals in 126 languages with the vast
majority in English. It covers all areas in science, technology,
medicine, social science and humanities
([www.doaj.org](http://www.doaj.org/))

##### **Pivoting Publishers**

The traditional, fee-based publishers are pivoting their business models
and will often have a subset of research released openly. Again, here is
where you will likely want to discuss this option with your Library to
understand the opportunity and limitations.

-   EBSCO Free Databases

-   Elsevier: Open Science

-   [ProQuest PQDT Open](https://pqdtopen.proquest.com/search.html):
    Open dissertations and theses

-   SAGE Open

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Good news! These options also allow you to set up the same alerts for
  information as the fee-based databases. Set it up so the latest open
  research in your area(s) of interest come directly to you.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

##### **Open Data**

This area is likely beyond this basic introduction to searching for open
resources. But it is important to know that freeing research data is a
subset of the open movement. With governments' commitment to opening
their data (e.g., <https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data>) researchers
gain easier access to relevant, current, quality data. If you want a
deeper dive with open data, [The Dataverse
Project](https://dataverse.org/) provides a sound start.

#### **Day 6 Activity - Gap Minded and Mined**

Ideally, you now have the confidence to take a moment and firm up your
search strategy and the willingness to explore open resources to meet
your information needs. Before you leave Day 6, Tweet out or share in
the discussion forum a a tidbit or takeaway that will assist your future
bridge building #MakingSense18
